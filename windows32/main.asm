.DATA

	; The purpose of this program is to find the weighted average of 4 grades,
	; each with an independent weight.

	; We will be using DWORDS, because the problem spec said to.
	; We will treat all values as unsigned integers, because this problem does not involve
	; any negative numbers.
	
	grade1			DWORD	0
	grade2			DWORD	0
	grade3			DWORD	0
	grade4			DWORD	0
	
	weight1			DWORD	0
	weight2			DWORD	0
	weight3			DWORD	0
	weight4			DWORD	0
	
	weightedGrade1	DWORD	0	; = grade1 * weight1
	weightedGrade2	DWORD	0	; = grade2 * weight2
	weightedGrade3	DWORD	0	; = grade3 * weight3
	weightedGrade4	DWORD	0	; = grade4 * weight4

	weightedSum		DWORD	0	; = weightedGrade1 + weightedGrade2 + weightedGrade3 + weightedGrade4

	sumOfWeights	DWORD	0	; = weight1 + weight2 = weight3 + weight4

	; FINAL RESULT
	weightedAverage	DWORD	0	; = weightedSum / sumOfWeights


	; The input macro expects a C-string (null terminated string) to display as a prompt.

	; We need 8 prompts, 4 for grades and 4 for weights, and the prompts are almost exactly
	; the same for each, except that each ends with a number that will increment with each use.
	; Instead of duplicating the same prompt 4 times in memory, we will use one prompt and change
	; the number before each use.

	; The actual prompts will look like:
	; "Grade 1:"
	; or
	; "Weight 3:"
	; depending on the iteration.

	gradePrompt		BYTE	"Grade "		; Stays constant
	gradeNumber		BYTE	"X"				; "X" will be replaced by "1", "2", "3", or "4" at runtime
					BYTE	" [0-100]:", 0	; Stays constant - null terminated

	weightPrompt	BYTE	"Weight "		; Stays constant
	weightNumber	BYTE	"X"				; "X" will be replaced with a ASCII coded digit at runtime
					BYTE	" [0-100]:", 0	; Stays constant - null terminated

	; The input macro needs a C-string to store the data in.
	; We're using a 4 character string because our valid input range is 0 to 100,
	; and the largest valid input will be "100", and we need four bytes
	; to store "100" as a C-string (3 ASCII digits + Null terminator)

	inputStr		BYTE	4	DUP	(0)

	; The output macro needs a C-string (null-terminated string) to display as a label,
	; and a C-string to display as a message.

	; outputValue will be replaced at runtime with an 11 character string which will hold the decimal
	; value of weightedAverage

	outputLabel		BYTE	"Weighted Average:", 0	; Label to be displayed upon output
	outputValue		BYTE	11	DUP	("X")			; Space for result of dtoa (11 ASCII coded bytes)
					BYTE	0						; Null string terminator
